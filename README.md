# Tacoholics Anonymous
 
 This was an attempt to make a single-page website. When it came down to it, this project was less about elegance and more about experimenting with different technologies. There are scroll 
 animations using jQuery and CSS, there are weird linear-gradient backgrounds, there are scrollbar modifications that only appear in Chrome, there are cheeky and totally unnecessary bits of Angular 1 code, there are background images that have static parallax effects (except on Safari-based browsers) and there are drop-down navigation links 
 instead of a hamburger button for the small-screen version. Definitely a weird project -- and it exists because of a pun.

### User stories: <br />
* User can navigate using a navigation bar/drop-down menu. They will be taken exactly to that section and other sections will be out of sight.*
* User can view the website across different devices.
* User can gather different information about the company.
* User can view scroll animations as they scroll down the site.
* User can send an email using the contact form.



*Side note: The goal was to have each heading of the sections line-up to the top of the page when clicking on a navigation link. I'm bothered by 
single page websites that leave you halfway through another section when you click 'Contact', then present their Contact section at the very bottom of the page. 
According to eye-tracking research, people browse screens with an "F" pattern. Important information should at least be at eye-level.
